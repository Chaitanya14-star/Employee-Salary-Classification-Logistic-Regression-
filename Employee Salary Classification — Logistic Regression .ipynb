    "When data scientists may come across a new classification problem, the first algorithm that may come across their mind is Logistic Regression. It is a supervised learning classification algorithm which is used to predict observations to a discrete set of classes. Practically, it is used to classify observations into different categories. Hence, its output is discrete in nature. Logistic Regression is also called Logit Regression. It is one of the most simple, straightforward and versatile classification algorithms which is used to solve classification problems.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the Logistic Regression model is a widely used statistical model which is primarily used for classification purposes. It means that given a set of observations, Logistic Regression algorithm helps us to classify these observations into two or more discrete classes. So, the target variable is discrete in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logistic Regression algorithm works as follows -**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Implement linear equation**  \n",
    "Logistic Regression algorithm works by implementing a linear equation with independent or explanatory variables to predict a response value. For example, we consider the example of number of hours studied and probability of passing the exam. Here, number of hours studied is the explanatory variable and it is denoted by x1. Probability of passing the exam is the response or target variable and it is denoted by y.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have one explanatory variable (x1) and one response variable (y), then the linear equation would be given mathematically with the following equation-  \n",
    "\n",
    "y = β0 + β1x1  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the coefficients β0 and β1 are the parameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are multiple explanatory variables, then the above equation can be extended to\n",
    "\n",
    "y = β0 + β1x1+ β2x2+……..+ βnxn\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the coefficients β0, β1, β2 and βn are the parameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the predicted response value is given by the above equations and is denoted by y."

    "**2. Sigmoid Function**  \n",
    "This predicted response value, denoted by y is then converted into a probability value that lie between 0 and 1. We use the sigmoid function in order to map predicted values to probability values. This sigmoid function then maps any real value into a probability value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, sigmoid function is used to map predictions to probabilities. The sigmoid function has an S shaped curve. It is also called sigmoid curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Sigmoid function is a special case of the Logistic function. It is given by the following mathematical formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Decision boundary**  \n",
    "The sigmoid function returns a probability value between 0 and 1. This probability value is then mapped to a discrete class which is either “0” or “1”. In order to map this probability value to a discrete class (pass/fail, yes/no, true/false), we select a threshold value. This threshold value is called Decision boundary. Above this threshold value, we will map the probability values into class 1 and below which we will map values into class 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the decision boundary is set to 0.5. So, if the probability value is 0.8 (> 0.5), we will map this observation to class 1. Similarly, if the probability value is 0.2 (< 0.5), we will map this observation to class 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Making predictions**  \n",
    "Now, we know about sigmoid function and decision boundary in logistic regression. We can use our knowledge of sigmoid function and decision boundary to write a prediction function. A prediction function in logistic regression returns the probability of the observation being positive, Yes or True. We call this as class 1 and it is denoted by P(class = 1). If the probability inches closer to one, then we will be more confident about our model that the observation is in class 1, otherwise it is in class 0.\n"

    "### Assumptions of Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dependent variable type**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The outcome you are predicting should be **categorical**.\n",
    "   * Usually: **binary** (Yes/No), **multinomial** (Red/Blue/Green), or **ordinal** (Low/Medium/High).\n",
    "   * **Example:** Predict if a delivery is **On-time (1) or Delayed (0)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independent observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each observation should be **separate and unrelated**.\n",
    "   * You shouldn’t use multiple measurements of the same package or person without adjustment.\n",
    "   * **Example:** Delivery times for different packages on the same day are fine, but repeated scans of the same package shouldn’t be treated as separate observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Little or no multicollinearity**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Independent variables should **not be too similar** to each other.\n",
    "   * **Example:** If you include both “Distance in km” and “Delivery Time in hours” in your model, they may be highly correlated. This can confuse the model. Pick one or transform the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Linearity of independent variables and log odds**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Logistic regression assumes a **straight-line relationship between each independent variable and the log odds** of the outcome.\n",
    "   * **Example:** Longer distances should steadily increase the probability of delay, not in a weird random way.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adequate sample size**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The model works best with a **large number of observations**.\n",
    "   * **Example:** If you only have 10 deliveries, predictions will be unreliable. A few thousand records give more stable and accurate results.\n",
