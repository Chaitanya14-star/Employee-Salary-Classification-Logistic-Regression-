# Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project explains Logistic Regression, a widely used statistical and machine learning technique for binary classification. It covers core concepts like the sigmoid function, decision boundary, prediction process, and assumptions for building effective models.

## Project Steps

Introduced the sigmoid function to map predicted values to probabilities between 0 and 1.

Explained decision boundary to convert probabilities into discrete classes (0/1).

Demonstrated the prediction process using probability outputs for class assignment.

Discussed assumptions of logistic regression, including dependent variable type, independent observations, multicollinearity, linearity of log odds, and adequate sample size.

## Tools Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## Insights

Logistic regression effectively models binary outcomes.

Sigmoid function ensures probabilities are interpretable between 0 and 1.

Decision boundaries allow threshold-based classification.

Following assumptions ensures reliable predictions and avoids model pitfalls.

## Result
The project serves as a practical learning resource for beginners to understand the mechanics of logistic regression, make predictions, and interpret results in binary classification tasks.
